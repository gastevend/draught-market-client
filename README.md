# Draught Exchange

A fun game played at the bar that takes the beers that are on tap and puts them into a stock exchange, where high-demand beers increase in price and low-demand beers decrease in price. Its economics, don't make POUR decisions

## Approach

My approach for this appplication was to get to MVP as directly as possible and worry about the bells and whistles later. I wanted to nail down the stock market logic quickly so that I knew I could acomplish something like this. That was a lot of fun coming up with my calculations on how I was going to do it. I spent A LOT more time on wireframes this time around which helped me so much. I felt way more in control this time around as far as knowing exactly what would happen when I wrote a peice of code.

I actually had planned on doing project two over and implementing ember but eventually decided against it. I wanted to focus a little more on mobile this time around which I did. Although not a requirment I still think its pretty important.

## Major Hurdles

I actually had a tough time with Ember to start out with I think if we had more than 4 days I would have been able to eventually figure it out. But i spent some time reviewing it and had a hard time. UI design is always a tough one for me but this time around I at least got some animations in there.
